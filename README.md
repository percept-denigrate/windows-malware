# Malware

Small windows malware that exfiltrates data through a discord webhook. The repo contains 2 cargo projects, one for the payload that will be persistently executed, and one for the injector (to be hidden as a file) that will download the payload.

⚠️ Developped as a class project for demonstration purposes, don't use it for anything illegal.

## Building

- build the payload, preferably in release profile
- upload the payload to a file hosting website, or as a discord attachment
- put the url of the payload in `injector/src/constants.rs`
- build the injector

## Crosscompiling

To compile for windows on linux, run `cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

The compiled binary for the payload will be in `payload/target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/payload.exe`, same path for the injector with `injector` instead of `payload`.

You can make the directory shared with a windows VM for testing.

## Plan

MVP:
- [x] persistence via startup folder 
- [x] gather basic system info 
- [x] send to discord webhhok 

Additional:
- [x] keylogging 
- [x] browser cookies 
- [x] browser passwords 
- [ ] telegram, steam, discord tokens
- [x] screenshots
- [ ] recall data
- [x] persistence via regkey 
- [x] anti-VM, anti-debug 
- [ ] packing
- [ ] obfuscation
- [ ] data encryption
