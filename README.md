# Malware

Small windows malware that exfiltrates data through a discord webhook. The repo contains 2 cargo projects, one for the payload that will be persistently executed, and one for the injector (to be hidden as a file) that will download the payload.

## Crosscompiling

To compile for windows on linux, run `cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`

The compiled binary for the payload will be in `payload/target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/debug/payload.exe`, same path for the injector with `injector` instead of `payload`.

You can make the directory shared with a windows VM for testing.

## Plan

MVP:
- persistence via startup folder ✅
- gather basic system info
- send to discord webhhok ✅

Additional:
- keylogging
- browser cookies
- browser passwords
- telegram, steam, discord tokens
- persistence via regkey
- anti-VM, anti-debug
- packing
- obfuscation
